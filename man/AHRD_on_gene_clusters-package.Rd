Automated Assignment of Human Readable Descriptions on Gene Clusters generated by Markov Clustering
~~ AHRD.on.gene.clusters ~~
}
\description{
  AHRD.on.gene.clusters annotates Gene Clusters with Human Readable
  Descriptions. Gene Clusters are sets of amino acid sequence of significant
  similarity.

  Gene clusters, interpreted as gene families, enable several conclusions and
  interpretations: Like gene expansion or loss in a certain organism,
  phylogenetic reconstruction in order to reconstruct the evolutionary history
  of the genes of your interest etc.

  The problem is, that no cluster has a short, concise, and trustworthy human
  readable description that gives you a quick overview of what kind of gene
  family you are dealing with here. And typically you have many such clusters.
  â€“ In the Tomato genome for istance we had 17,490!

  This version of AHRD (see https://github.com/groupschoof/AHRD for the
  original used to describe single query proteins) provides a simple method to
  annotate such gene clusters.

# Have the InterPro annotations ready in a data.frame. The data.frame is required
# to have two columns, in which the first is to hold the gene accession and the
# second the annotated InterPro entry. In order to get correct frequencies it is
# necessary to ensure that each protein's InterPro annotation only appears once.
# To ensure use unique(...) after reading in the InterPro annotations.
gene.2.ipr.df <- unique( read.table( 'my.ipr.annos.csv', stringsAsFactors=FALSE ) )

# Load the downloaded InterPro database into memory:
ipr.db <- parseInterProXML( './interpro.xml' ) 

# Annotate your gene families:
mcl.fams.hrds <- lapply( mcl.fams, annotateCluster, ipr.annos=gene.2.ipr.df,
  interpro.database=ipr.db )
# Usage of mclapply is recommended:
