Automated Assignment of Human Readable Descriptions on Gene Clusters generated by OrthoMCL

h2. Introduction

"AHRD_on_gene_clusters" is small Ruby project that annotates Gene Clusters with Human Readable Descriptions. Gene Clusters are sets of amino acid sequence of significant similarity. Typcially they are found -or generated- by the following method:

1. A database is decided upon: Use the proteome of the organism you are invetigating, typically all freshly sequenced Amina Acid Sequences and join it with reference proteomes.
2. Run a Blast "all vs all" search, finding for each protein those it is significantly similar to.
3. Based on the resulting BLAST scores cluster above Proteins using a Markov Clustering approach as implemented in OrthoMCL

The resultin clusters can be interpreted as gene families and enable several conclusions and interpretations: Like gene expansion or loss in a certain organism, phylogenetic reconstruction in order to reconstruct the evolutionary history of the genes of your interest etc.

The problem is, that no cluster has a *short, concise, and trustworthy human readable description* that gives you a quick overview of what kind of gene family you are dealing with here. And typically you have many such clusters. - In the Tomato genome for istance we had 17,490!

This version of AHRD (see https://github.com/groupschoof/AHRD for the original used to describe _single_ query proteins) provides a simple method to annotate such gene clusters.

h2. Algorithm

"AHRD_on_gene_clusters" first reads in the latest InterPro database and InterProScan annotations for the above proteins (see Introduction). Then it annotates each gene cluster with a Human Readable Description (HRD) as follows:

For each gene in the current cluster:

1. Find the most frequently annotated InterPro Family
2. Assign it as the cluster's HRD
3. Compute the HRD's score as the annotation frequency of the InterPro Family in the current cluster. That is the fraction of the cluster's Proteins annotated with this InterPro Family.
4. If _no_ InterPro Family reaches the custom _threshhold_ frequency of 0.5, use any other InterPro annotation, for instance a Domain.
5. Generate a HRD as follows: "[AHRD-Score] TAB interpro_id TAB InterPro-Type TAB InterPro-Name"

h2. Installation

You need ruby, version 1.8.7 or greater.

bc. git clone git://github.com/groupschoof/AHRD_on_gene_clusters.git

h2. Usage

bc. ruby generate_ahrd_for_gene_cluster_run.rb [path_to_your_analysis.rb]

Then adjust the _well_ documented paths inside the above @path_to_your_analysis.rb@ - or the default @ahrd_on_gene_clusters_<today's date>.rb@.

Finally run it and give it quite some time…
