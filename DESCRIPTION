Description: OrthoMCL or InParanoid generate clusters of proteins, that share a significant sequence similarity. Those clusters are interpreted as gene families sharing a common ancestor. Typically such a clustering results in tens of thousands of families, that require short human redable descriptions in order to enable the quick identification of families of interest. AHRD.on.gene.clusters does just that.
