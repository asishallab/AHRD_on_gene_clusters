Description: OrthoMCL or InParanoid or simply MCL generate clusters of
    proteins, that share a significant sequence similarity. Those clusters are
    interpreted as gene families sharing a common ancestor. Typically such a
    clustering results in tens of thousands of families, that require short
    human redable descriptions in order to enable the quick identification of
    families of interest. AhrdOnGeneClusters does just that. Both using
    frequent InterPro annotations as well as frequent protein descriptions
    found within each respective family.
